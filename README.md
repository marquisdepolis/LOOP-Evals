# LOOP-Evals
Logical Operations On Puzzles: Simple Iterative Reasoning Tests for LLMs first through wordgrids

# Purpose
LLMs are hard to evaluate, so I wanted to test its ability to iteratively reason. The simplest version of it is whether it can create wordgrids, successively in 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5.

This is a) easy to create, and b) easy to evaluate, while still being hard to do!
